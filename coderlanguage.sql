Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python\'s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]\r\n\r\nPython is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[29]\r\n\r\nPython was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.\r\n\r\nPython 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.\r\n\r\nThe Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and \"Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release.\"[30] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[31][32] With Python 2\'s end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x[33] and later are supported.\r\n\r\nPython interpreters are available for many operating systems.
